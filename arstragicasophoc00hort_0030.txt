2 “ The Pantheon is not more different from Westminster Abbey or
the church of St. Stephen at Vienna, than the structure of a tragedy
of Sophocles from a drama of Shakspeare. The comparison between
these wonderful productioris of poetry and architecture might be
carried still further. But does our admiration of the one compel
us to depreciate the other? May we not admit that each is great
and admirable in its kind, although the one is, and is meant to be,
different from the other?'’ Schlegel, op. cit„ Lect. i.‚ p. 233 cf.
etiam Lect. xxii„ pp. 340- 344. Haud aliter Hazlitt‚ Lectures chiefly
on tlte Dramatic Literature of tlte Age of Elz'zabetlc (ed. 2, 1821),
Lect. viii„ pp. 320, 321: “Sophocles differs from Shakespear as
a Doric portico does from Westminster Abbey. The principle of
the one is simplicity and harmony‚ of the other richness and power.
The one relies on form or proportion, the other on quantity and
variety and prominence os parts. The one owes its charrn to a
certain union and regularity of feeling, the other adds to its effect
from eomplexity and the combination of the greatest extremes. The
classical appeals to sense and habit: the Gothic οι· romantic strikes
from novelty, strangeness and contrast. Both are founded in essential
and indestructible principles of human nature. We may prefer the
one to the other, as we chuse, but to set up an arbitrary and bigotted
standard of excellence in consequence of this preference, and to
exclude either one or the other from poetry or art, is to deny the
existence of the first principles of the human mind, and to war with
nature, which is the height of weakness and arrogance at once.''
