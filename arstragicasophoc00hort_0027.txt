1890), pp. 74, 75, “He whose powers of aetion have been eaten
up by thought...this is the true Hamlet''; et ib„ pp. 7678, “ He
(Hamlet) seems incapable of deliberate action, and is only
hurried into extremities on the spur of the occasion, when he has
no time to reflect. At other times, when he is most bound to act,
he remains puzzled, undecided and sceptical, dallies with his pur-
poses, till the occasion is lost, and finds out some pretence to
relapse into indolence and thoughtfulness agaim... He is the
prince of philosophical speculators...he does nothing; and this
very speculation on his own infirmity only affords him another
occasion for indulging it.... His ruling passion is to think, not
to act.'’
