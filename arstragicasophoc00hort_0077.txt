II. (8) TRAGIC MATERIAL. 500 B.C. Sc 1600 A.D. 53

Shaksperius contra, nulla eiusmodi relligione
oppressus, si quid ex antiquitatis vel aetatis
recentioris historia collegerat, si quid ex fabulis
commenticiis, si quid denique ex tragoediis iam
compositis, hoc omne, quemadmodum voluit, ad
scenam componebat ;1 et praeterea, id quod Graecis
poetis haudquaquam licuit, fabulas usurpatas ita
tractavit ut alteri nonnunquam alteram subtiliter

intexeret, fabulaeque ipsius exitum ultro com-
mutaret.2

Nec nos in tali disputatione fallat quantum
temporis inter Sophoclem et Shaksperium prae-
terierit. Mementote enim haec Lucretii verba:

“Augescunt aliae gentes, aliae minuuntur,
Inque brevi spatio mutantur saecla animantum.'⁷³

Quid mirum igitur si post duo annorum millia

1 Cf. Hazlitt, Lectum, Lect. i.‚ p. 25: “ All the disposeable
materials that had been accumulating for a long period of time,
either in our own, or in foreign countries, were now brought to-
gether, and required nothing more than to be wrought up, polished,
or arranged in striking forms, for ornament and use '³ ; et ila, pp. 28,
29: “ Fancy’s air-drawn pictures after history’s waking dream shewed
like clouds over mountains 3 and from the romanoe of real life to the
idlest fiction, the transition seemed easy.—Shakespear‚ as well as
others of his time, availed himself of the old Chronicles, and of the
traditions or fabulous inventions contained in them in such ample
measure, and which had not yet been appropriated to the purposes
of poetry or the drama. The stage was a new thing3 and those who
had to supply its demands laid their hands upon whatever came
within their reach 3 they were not particular as to the means, so that
they gained the end. Lear is founded upon an old ballad ; Othello
on an Italian novel ; Hamlet on a Danish, and Macbeth on a Scotch
tradition.’'
