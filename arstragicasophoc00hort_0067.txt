11. (4) THE THREE UNITIEs. 43

distinguitur Shaksperiana. Nec non hanc copiam
admiratur ipse Aristoteles: ‘O κατ’ αὐτὴν τὴν φύσιν
τοῦ πράγματος ὅρος, ἀεὶ μὲν ὁ μείζων μέχρι τοῦ
σύνδηλος εἶναι καλλίων ἐστὶ κατὰ τὸ μέγεθος.1
Nonne hoc Shaksperio concedendum est, ut
σύνδηλος in unaquaque tragoediarum emineat ὁ κατ’
αὐτὴν τὴν φύσιν τοῦ πράγματος ὅρος.Ρ Nihil nisi
cum tragoediae exitu congruenter cohaerens, nihil
nisi exitui ipsi optime conducturum? usquam
admisit Shaksperius. Summatim igitur, simplex
ars tragica Sophoclea, Shaksperiana multiplex, sed
ita ut Actionis Unitas penitus sustineatur.3
Quid deinde de Temporis Unitate dicam? nevus-ty

2 Optime Coleridge, op. cit„ Pars ΙΙ. , ξ iv„ p. 389 : “The unity
of action . . . would, perhaps, have been as appropriately, as
well as more intelligibly, entitled the unity of interest. . . . It
is . . . in itself the great end . . . os the drama, . . . nay of poesy
in general.’' Cf. etiam Schlegel, Op. cit„ Lect. xvii., p. 243.

3 Conferamus haec verba elegantissima quibus nostra de Shak-
sperii copia sententia confirmatur: “Rather let us suppose it
(Tragedy) a mighty stream, which in its impetuous course overcomes
many obstructions, and loses itself at last in the repose of the ocean.
It springs perhaps from different sources, and certainly receives into
itself other rivers, which hasten towards it from opposite regions.
Why should not the poet be allowed to carry on several, and, for
a while, independent streams of human passions and endeavours,
down to the moment of their raging junetion, if only he can place
the spectator on an eminence from whence he may overlook the
whole of their course? And if this great and swollen body of
waters again divide into several branches, and pour itself into the
sea by several mouths, is it not still one and the same stream?''
Schlegel, op. cit„ Lect. xvii., p. 245.

4 “ Continuity of Time‚—sor this is what ⁶ Unity of Time ³ really
denotes.'’ Butcher‚ op. cit„ cap. vii„ p. 270.
