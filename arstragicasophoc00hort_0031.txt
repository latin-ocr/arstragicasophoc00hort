1. (2) TRAGEDY: ITS FORM. 7

sperius noster minime laudatus est, quorum unus
Hamletum, tragoediam Shaksperii eximiam, scilicet
idcirco graviter ac severe reprehendit quod nihil
in ea Sophocleum dispiciaturll

IV.‚ p. 1, “Hamlet est une composition entierement barbare,
oh l’on ne decouvre aucune trace des idees et de la maniere de
Sophocle.'’ Haud aliter F. M. A. de Voltaire, OEuvres Compli'tes‚
ed. 1791-1792, yol. LXVIII. (pp. 275-285, De la Trage'dz‘e Anglaz'seh
p. 275, “ Shakespeare, que les Anglais prennent pour un Sophocle,

. . avait un genie plein de force et de feeondite'‚ de naturel et de
sublime, sans la moindre etincelle de bon gout et sans la moindre con-
naissance des regles.'’ ‘⁴ On the continent‚'' ait Coleridge (op. cit„
Pars I., Lect. ii.‚ pp. 50, 51), “the works of Shakspere are honoured
in a double way—by the admiration of the Germans, and by
the contempt of the French. Among other points of objection
taken by the French, perhaps, the most noticeable is, that he
has not observed the sacred unities‚ so hallowed by the practice
of their own extolled tragedians. They hold, of course, after
Corneille and Racine, that Sophocles is the most perfect model
for tragedy, and Aristone its most infallible censor; and that
as Hamlet, Lear, Maebeffl, and other dramas by Shakspere,
are not framed upon that model, and consequently not subject
to the same laws, they maintain (not having impartiality enough
to question the model, or to deny the rules of the Stagirite)
that Shakspere was a sort of irregular genius—that he is now
and then tasteful and touching, but generally incorrect; and, in
short, that he was a mere child of nature, who did not know any
better than to write as he has written.'' Cf. etiam Coleridge‚ op. cil„
