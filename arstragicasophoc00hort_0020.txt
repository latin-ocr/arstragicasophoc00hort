SYNOPSIS OF THE ESSAY.

(2) Origin of the Greek Drama and of the English Drama.

In its Origin the Greek Drama Religions, but
brought to Perfection rather by the Stirring History
of the Time, eg. the Expulsion of the Tyrants, the
Rise of the Demos, and especially the Persian Wars.
Phases of Greek Religion—The Ideas of F ate, Destiny,
Family Curse—Religion of Sophocles—The ‘After-
Life’ as understood by Sophocles. - -

The Advent of Christianity-—New Views on Life—-
The Present Life regarded as a Preparation for Heaven
—The Middle Ages, 1n which arose (a) Chivalry, (b) a
New Conception of Love, and (c) 3 New Code of Per-
sonal Honour. Love in Shakspere as contrasted with

Century immediately preceding: the Discovery of
America, the Rise of the Burgher Class, the Refor-
mation, the Personality of Queen Elizabeffl, the
Revival of Learning (aided by the Invention of
Printing), and especially the Defeat of the Spanish
Armada. Shaksperian Tragedy not, like that of
Sophocles, permeated by Religion, but equally Re-
ligious notwithstanding-Shakspere’s Views on the
Great Mysteries of Life and Death—His Views on
Immortality.

(3) The ancient Chorus, (a) as an Actor, (h) as a Spectator—

Its essential Character and Office—The Chorus in
Sophocles Human rather than Ideal.

Shakspere⁷s ‘Chorus’ by no means identical with
the Chorus of Greek Tragedy. True Counterparts
thereto in Shakspere :—

(α) (α) Clowns and Fools, (β) Enobarbus, (γ) Friar
Laurence. - - - - . - . .

(b) Abstraet Reflection on the part of the Actors,
whether in Soliloquy or otherwise.

(4) Results of the Continual Presenee of the Chorus.
